Project Portfolio

What is it?
My project portfolio with some placeholders for future projects.
The first version of this portfolio doesn't use any frameworks (like bootstrap),
but I hope to add them soon.

Where do I get it?
The main repository of this code is https://github.com/marph13/portfolio.
Feel free to clone or fork it and use it the way you want!
Example:
	git clone https://github.com/marph13/movie_trailer_app.git

How do I run it?
I still don't have the page hosted, so open "portfolio.html" in your browser
and the page should render.

I have downloaded all the images unrelated with the projects from Pixabay:
